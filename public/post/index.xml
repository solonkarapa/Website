      <description>There are many tutorials for importing data in R, focusing on a specific function/package. This one focuses only on flat files, and compares 3 different packages. In this tutorial you will learn how to import all common formats of flat file data with base R functions and the dedicated readr and data.table packages. I first present the three - in my opinion - most used packages to import data into R and finish with a comparison table between them.</description>

      <description>Recently, I came across this very interesting article published in Science about how plastic waste is associated with disease on coral reefs (J. B. Lamb et al. 2018). The main conclusions are
contact with plastic increases the probability of disease,
 the structure of the reefs is associated with the probability of being in contact with plastic with more complex ones being more likely to be affected by plastic,
 the plastic levels correspond to estimates of mismanaged plastic waste into the ocean.</description>
