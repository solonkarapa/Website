abstract = "**Background** False positive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) phenotypes prompt unnecessary biopsies. The Prostate MRI Imaging Study (PROMIS) provides a unique opportunity to explore such phenotypes in biopsy-naïve men with raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and suspected cancer. **Objective** To compare mpMRI lesions in men with/without significant cancer on transperineal mapping biopsy (TPM).**Design, setting, and participants** PROMIS participants (n=235) underwent mpMRI followed by a combined biopsy procedure at University College London Hospital, including 5-mm TPM as the reference standard. Patients were divided into four mutually exclusive groups according to TPM findings: (1) no cancer, (2) insignificant cancer, (3) definition 2 significant cancer (Gleason ≥3 + 4 of any length and/or maximum cancer core length ≥4 mm of any grade), and (4) definition 1 significant cancer (Gleason ≥4 + 3 of any length and/or maximum cancer core length ≥6 mm of any grade). **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis** Index and/or additional lesions present in 178 participants were compared between TPM groups in terms of number, conspicuity, volume, location, and radiological characteristics. **Results and limitations** Most lesions were located in the peripheral zone. More men with significant cancer had two or more lesions than those without significant disease (67% vs 37%; p < 0.001). In the former group, index lesions were larger (mean volume 0.68 vs 0.50 ml; p< 0.001, Wilcoxon test), more conspicuous (Likert 4–5: 79% vs 22%; p < 0.001), and diffusion restricted (mean apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]: 0.73 vs 0.86; p < 0.001, Wilcoxon test). In men with Likert 3 index lesions, log2PSA density and index lesion ADC were significant predictors of definition 1/2 disease in a logistic regression model (mean cross-validated area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve: 0.77 [95% confidence interval: 0.67–0.87]). **Conclusions** Significant cancer-associated MRI lesions in biopsy-naïve men have clinical-radiological differences, with lesions seen in prostates without significant disease. MRI-calculated PSA density and ADC could predict significant cancer in those with indeterminate MRI phenotypes."
