I'm a researcher at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/). 
<br><br>
I'm interested in many areas across statistics, machine learning, and their interactions. My research focuses on [tailored model development](https://www.solon-karapanagiotis.com/publication/tailoredbayes/), that is targeted model building for a specific task of interest, mostly prediction.  
<br>
 I'm also developing and applying tools leveraging genomics to detect cancer earlier, which will ultimately lead to more personalized treatment for patients. Toward these goals, I draw from a wide range of disciplines, including molecular biology, computational biology, and medical oncology. More specifically, Iâ€™m looking at novel ways to incorporate liquid biopsies into the management of cancer. Liquid biopsies - the analysis of tumours using biomarkers circulating in fluids such as the blood - have the potential to change the way cancer is diagnosed, monitored, and treated.
<!--- I'm interested in many areas across statistics, machine learning, and their interactions. My research focuses on tailored model development, that is targeted model building for a specific task of interest, mostly prediction. Under this scenario it is desired to use a metric which reflects the loss function to be used for the prediction problem thus "making" the model perform well for the particular task. 
<br><br>
I'm also looking at novel ways to detect cancer directly from the blood through "liquid biopsies" which has the potential to change the way cancer is diagnosed, monitored, and even treated. My research focuses on novel ways to incorporate circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) into the management of cancer patients.

I obtained my PhD from the MRC Biostatistics Unit under the supervision of [Paul Newcombe](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/paul-newcombe/) and [Oscar Rueda](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/oscar-rueda/). 
Before starting my PhD, I studied for a [MSc in Statistics](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_50550147.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/). 

<!--- I'm a PhD student at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/), currenly supervised by [Oscar #Rueda](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/oscar-rueda/) at the [MRC Biostatistics #Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/).

<!--- Our approach is based on general Bayesian learning by incorporating loss functions into Bayesian inference. We will explore the use of such a framework for predictive and prognostic model building, whereby loss functions could be used to target metrics of real world clinical utility tailored to a particular setting. -->

I focused on the Biometrics track and wrote my dissertation under the supervision of professor [Geert Verbeke](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00018341). I worked as Research Scientist at the MRC Biostatistics Unit during the 2016-2017 academic year supervised by [Paul Newcombe](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/paul-newcombe/) and [Chris Jackson](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/h-to-m/christopher-jackson/). -->
