<p>Solution to <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25133522-800-puzzle-131-what-is-the-probability-of-winning-this-game-of-chance/#ixzz775sxHixz">#131 “The Paradise Club”</a> puzzle from the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a>. This week (No 3352 - 18 September 2021) the New Scientist posted the following puzzle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Down at The Paradise Club, Gus and Bart take it in turns to roll a pair of dice. The first person to score his favourite score for two dice wins, which means being treated to a drink by the other (the loser). They each favour a different prime number as a score with two dice and it so happens that their chances of getting their favourite score is the same for each.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is that probability? If Gus goes first what are his chances of being bought a drink?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The maximum score (i.e. sum) when rolling two dice is 12. The prime numbers from 2 (the minimum score) to 12 are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11\]</span></p>
<p>Each score can be the result of the following dice combinations</p>
<p>2: {1, 1}</p>
<p>3: {2, 1}</p>
<p>5: {2, 3}, {4, 1}</p>
<p>7: {4, 3}, {5, 2}, {6, 1}</p>
<p>11: {6, 5}</p>
<p>For example, a score of 2 can only be achieved if both dice are {1, 1} (1 combination in total). A score of 3 can be achieved either with {2, 1} or {1, 2} (2 combinations in total). A score of 5 can be achieved with {2, 3} or {4, 1} or {3, 2} or {1, 4} (4 combinations in total).</p>
<p>The table below shows the total number of combinations for each score</p>

<p>The puzzle states that the chances of getting their favourite score is the same for Gus and Bart. Since each combination is equiprobable<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the only scores that result in the same chances are 3 and 11.</p>
<p>Now we need to find that probability. We can calculate it as</p>
<p>Probability = Number of favourable combinations/total number of combinations</p>
<p>We already know the number of favourable combinations (i.e. the number of combinations that will give the win) - it is 2. There are 2 ways to get a score of 3 or 11 (see table). The total number of combinations is 36. There are 36 possible outcomes when we roll two dice (6 from the first and 6 from the second die).</p>
<p>Hence, the probability of getting their favourite score is <span class="math inline">\(2/36 \text{ or } 1/18\)</span> and it is the same for both.</p>
<p>Then, we are asked: “If Gus goes first what are his chances of being bought a drink?”
That is, what are his chances of winning? Gus wins if he rolls his favourite score or both Bart and Gus fail - in which case they continue the game. Let W denote the event that Gus wins. The probability of W is</p>
<p>P(W) = P(Gus rolls his favourite score ) + P(both fail)</p>
<p>This is usually called the addition rule<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. We already know the first term, the probability of rolling his favourite score is <span class="math inline">\(1/18\)</span>. The second term can be decomposed as</p>
<p>P(both fail) = P(Bart fails and Gus fails) =</p>
<p>P(Bart fails given that Gus fails) P(Gus fails)</p>
<p>P(Bart fails given that Gus fails) (1 - P(W))</p>
<p>To go from the first to the second line I used the multiplication rule<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Also, P(Gus fails) = 1 - P(Gus wins) = 1 - P(W). The first term in the last line (P(Bart fails given that Gus fails)) is equal to the probability that Bart fails, which is 1-P(Bart rolls his favourite score) = 1 - 1/18 = 17/18. So rewriting our previous equation we have</p>
<p>P(W) = P(Gus rolls his favourite score) + P(both fail)</p>
<p>P(W) = P(Gus rolls his favourite score) + P(Bart fails given that Gus fails) (1 - P(W))</p>
<p>P(W) = 1/18 + 17/18(1 - P(W))</p>
<p>P(W) = 18/35</p>
<p>The probability of Gus winning, if he goes first, is 18/35.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>The addition rule states that for two events A and B, the probability that either one or both events occur is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). The last term, P(A and B), is the probability that both events occur. In our case, it is zero because we cannot have a score of 3 and 11 at the same time, they cannot occur together when rolling a pair of dice.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The multiplication rule states that the probability that both events occur is P(A and B) = P(A) P(B given A) or P(B) P(A given B). P(A given B) means the probability that event A occurs given event B has occurred.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
