<p>Solution to <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25133522-800-puzzle-131-what-is-the-probability-of-winning-this-game-of-chance/#ixzz775sxHixz">#131 “The Paradise Club”</a> puzzle from the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a>. This week (No 3352 - 18 September 2021) the New Scientist posted the following puzzle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Down at The Paradise Club, Gus and Bart take it in turns to roll a pair of dice. The first person to score his favourite score for two dice wins, which means being treated to a drink by the other (the loser). They each favour a different prime number as a score with two dice and it so happens that their chances of getting their favourite score is the same for each.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is that probability? If Gus goes first what are his chances of being bought a drink?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The maximum score (i.e. sum) when rolling two dice is 12. The prime numbers from 2 (the minimum score) to 12 are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11\]</span></p>
<p>Each number can be the result of the following dice combinations</p>
<p>2: {1, 1}</p>
<p>3: {2, 1}</p>
<p>5: {2, 3}, {4, 1}</p>
<p>7: {4, 3}, {5, 2}, {6, 1}</p>
<p>11: {6, 5}</p>
<p>For example, a score of 2, can only be achieved if both dice are {1, 1} (1 combination in total). A score of 3 can be achieved either with {2, 1} or {1, 2} (2 combinations in total).</p>
<p>The table below shows the total number of combinations for each score</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The puzzle states that the chances of getting their favourite score is the same for Gus and Bart. Since each combination is equiprobable<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> the only scores that result in the same chances are 3 and 11.</p>
<p>Now we need to find that probability. We can calculate it as</p>
<p>Probability = Number of favourable combinations/ total number of combinations</p>
<p>We already know the number of favourable combinations (i.e. the number of combinations that will give the win) - it is 2. There are 2 ways to get a score of 3 or 11 (see table). The total number of combinations is 36. There are 36 possible outcomes when we roll two dice (6 from the first and 6 from the second die).</p>
<p>Hence, the probability of getting their favourite score is <span class="math inline">\(2/36 \text{ or } 1/18\)</span> and it is the same for both.</p>
<p>Then, we are asked: “If Gus goes first what are his chances of being bought a drink?” This the chance that Gus wins - the probability that he rolls his favourite score. We don’t know if his favourite score is 3 or 11, but we know the probability of rolling either 3 or 11 is equal to the sum of the probability of rolling 3 and the probability of rolling 11, that is<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(3 \text{ or } 11) = P(3) + P(11) \]</span>
and we know that <span class="math inline">\(P(3) = P(11)= 1/18\)</span>. So the probability Gus wins is <span class="math inline">\(2/18 = 1/9\)</span>.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I have assumed that each die is fair, that is the occurrence of each number is equally likely.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>This is usually called the addition rule. It states that for two events A and B, the probability that either one or both events occur is P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). The last term, P(A and B), is the probability that both events occur. In our case, it is zero because we cannot roll 3 and 11 at the same time, they cannot occur together when rolling a pair of dice.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
