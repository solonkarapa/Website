<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>(for blogpost)</p>
</div>
<div id="background" class="section level2">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence">Biological iridescence</a> (the vivid, shining coloring of many species) often serves to make individual animals more visible, and as a result, has been hypothesised to contribute to sexual selection. But the fact that it is found in non-reproductive stages makes the sexual selection hypothesis less likely. An alternative (and counterintuitive) hypothesis is that can work as a form of protection, aiming “to conceal rather than reveal” .</p>
<p><span class="citation">Kjernsmo et al. (<a href="#ref-kjernsmo2020iridescence" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> provide evidence for this hypothesis by showing that iridescence provides a survival advantage making the prey less detectable, effectively acting as camouflage.</p>
<p>The authors use a coloured beetle species as a test case. The beetle’s wings sport a shiny, shifting and metallic green-blue appearance stemming from structural colour. They then use a series of elegantly simple experiments to test the camouflage hypothesis. First, they put together a collection of hundreds of beetle wing cases, including the iridescent and non-iridescent beetles in a variety of colours, and distributed them in a natural setting amid a variety of plant species. They found, surprisingly, that the iridescent specimens were more likely to survive predation by birds than the non-iridescent variety—even outperforming a leaf-green non-iridescent model that should have blended in with the background colours.</p>
<p>Their conclusions are based on a mixed Cox model where the survival of the beetles was recorded at 2, 24, and 48 h. Predation by birds, which ate all or most of the mealworm, was scored as an event in the survival analysis. Predation by animals other than birds (non-birds), complete disappearance of a target, or survival to 48 h, were treated as censored values in the survival analysis<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Effectively this analyses ignores the competing risks. A <em>competing risk</em> is an event whose occurrence precludes the occurrence of the primary event of interest. Being eaten by other animals precludes to be eaten by birds!
Here, I re-analyse the data taking into account the competing risks.</p>
</div>
<div id="competing-risks" class="section level2">
<h2>Competing risks</h2>
<p>Competing risks concern the situation where more than one cause of failure is possible. It refers to situations where an event has occurred, which prevents occurrence of the primary event of interest. For instance, in this study, predation by non-birds prevents the occurrence of the primary event of interest, i.e. predation by birds.</p>
<p>A common assumption is that upon removal of one cause of failure, the risks of failure of the remaining causes is unchanged. That is, the competing risks are assumed independent. Two competing risks are said to be independent if information about a subject’s risk of experiencing 1 type of event provides no information about the subject’s risk of experiencing the other type of event. While this may be a reasonable assumption in some settings, independent competing risks may be relatively rare in biological applications.</p>
<p>When analyzing survival data in which competing risks are present, analysts frequently censor subjects when a competing event occurs (as done in this study). Thus, when the outcome is time to death attributable to birds, an analyst considers an insect as censored once that subject dies of non-bird causes (spiders etc). However, censoring insects at the time of death attributable to non-bird causes may be problematic.</p>
<p><strong>Elaborate</strong></p>
<div id="the-hazard-function" class="section level3">
<h3>The Hazard Function</h3>
<p>A key concept in survival analysis is that of the hazard function. In the absence of competing risks, the hazard function is defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{Prob(t \leq  T &lt; t + \Delta t | T &gt; t)}{\Delta t}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> denotes the time from baseline until the occurrence of the event of interest. The hazard function, which is a function of time, describes the instantaneous rate of occurrence of the event of interest in subjects who are still at risk of the event. In a setting in which the outcome was all-cause mortality, the hazard function at a given point in time would describe the instantaneous rate of death in subjects who were alive at that point in time.</p>
<p>Competing risks implies that a subject can experience one of a set of different events - an insect can be eaten by a bird (event 1) or by a non-bird (event 2). In this case, 2 different types of hazard functions are of interest: the cause-specific hazard function and the subdistribution hazard function. The <strong>cause-specific hazard function</strong> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lambda^{CS}(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{Prob(t \leq  T &lt; t + \Delta t, \color{blue}{E = k} | T &gt; t)}{\Delta t}\]</span>
The cause-specific hazard function denotes the instantaneous rate of occurrence of the k^{th} event (blue term) in subjects who are currently event free (i.e. in subjects who have not yet experienced any of the different types of events). If one were considering 2 types of events, death attributable to birds and death attributable to non-birds, then the cause-specific hazard of bird death denotes the instantaneous rate of bird death in subjects who have not yet experienced either event (i.e., in subjects who are still “alive”). The <strong>subdistribution hazard function</strong> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lambda^{SD}(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{Prob(t \leq  T &lt; t + \Delta t, \color{blue}{E = k} | T &gt; t \color{blue}{\cup (T &lt; t \cap E \neq k)})}{\Delta t}\]</span>
It denotes the instantaneous risk of failure from the kth event in subjects who have not yet experienced an event of type k (blue term). Note that this risk set includes those who are currently event free as well as those who have previously experienced a competing event. This differs from the risk set for the cause-specific hazard function, which only includes those who are currently event free. Using the same example as above, the subdistribution hazard of cardiovascular death denotes the instantaneous rate of cardiovascular death in subjects who are still alive (ie, who have not yet experienced either event) or who have previously died of noncardiovascular causes. There is a distinct cause-specific hazard function for each of the distinct types of events and a distinct subdistribution hazard function for each of the distinct types of events.</p>
