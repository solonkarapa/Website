Oct 2025 1 Comparison between cultures This comparison focuses on the period of overlap between the Norse and the Inuit (AD 1000–1200 and 1200–1400). Following the onset of the Little Ice Age in the fourteenth century AD, the Norse settlements in Greenland were eventually abandoned. The evidence suggests that Inuit society placed an emphasis on object play that prepared children for survival in the Arctic. This is reflected in the high frequency of social play objects and miniature weapons, which likely served as training tools for hunting. In contrast, Norse toys appear to relate primarily to agricultural activities. Children in Norse communities began farm work at an early age, which aligns with the higher prevalence of toy tools. Among the Inuit, little change in these categories is observable over time. For the Norse, the variation is more pronounced, although this pattern may simply reflect the limited sample size.
