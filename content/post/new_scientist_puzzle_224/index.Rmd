[Puzzle #224](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25834411-000-puzzle-224-can-you-find-the-ring-inside-the-russian-dolls/) from the New Scientist is:

> I collect Russian dolls, the type where each doll can be opened to reveal a smaller one inside. I am particularly fond of my simple, single-coloured ones, which come in sets of five (and, unusually, have a hollow smallest doll). I have five lovely sets of them, each a different colour.

> Alas, while I was out, my daughter Kira rearranged them so that each large doll now contains one each of the four other colours. She proudly tells me that no blue doll contains a doll that has a yellow doll anywhere within it. There is no doll that contains a pink doll with a red doll anywhere within it. And no yellow doll contains a green doll with a pink doll anywhere within it.

> “By the way, have you seen my wedding ring?” I ask her.

> “Ah, I put that inside the smallest blue doll” replies Kira.

> Which coloured doll should l open first if I want to find the ring as quickly as possible?


The figure shows all the possible arrangement of the five dolls. The index indicates the doll size: 5 for the smallest and 1 for the largest. The letter indicates the colour: R for red, Y for yellow and so on. 

As an example, the top path - `P1 R2 G3 Y4 B5`- corresponds to the combination pink, red, green, yellow and blue (from the largest to the smallest doll). 

`B5` occupies the left hand size since we know the smallest doll is blue. 

With the a few lines of code we aim to re-create the figure. As with the figure we have 24 possible arrangements.

```{r, message = F}
library(gtools)
library(stringi)
library(stringr)
library(rebus) 

colour <- c("blue", "yellow", "pink", "red", "green") # all the different colours

numb <- 1:5 # the size index (1 is the largest)

opt <- paste0(rep(colour, each = 5), "_", numb) # combine colour and index

perms <- permutations(n = 25, r = 5, v = opt, repeats.allowed = F) # all the combinations of 5 dolls

##### adding restrictions
# 1: select only the ones where blue is the smallest doll
blue_smallest_doll <- which(perms[,5] == "blue_5") # select only the ones where blue is the smallest doll

perms2 <- perms[blue_smallest_doll,]

# 2: select only the combinations where each color appears once and indexes are sorted correctly 
combs <- c()
for(i in 1:nrow(perms2)){
    perms3 <- stri_split_fixed(perms2[i,], "_", simplify = T) # split the vectors into two
    dupl <- sum(stri_duplicated(perms3[,1])) # check for uniqueness
    sorted <- is.unsorted(perms3[,2], strictly = T) # check for correct order 
    
    if(dupl == 0 & sorted == 0){
        combs <- rbind(perms2[i,], combs)
    }
}

combs 
```


Then, we need to take into account the additional restrictions:

1. "no doll that contains a pink doll with a red doll anywhere within it", and
2. "no yellow doll contains a green doll with a pink doll anywhere within it".

The first one is easy. We need to discard all solutions where pink is followed by red. This gives us 12 remaining solutions. 

```{r}
# 3: apply first restrictions 
pattern_pink_red <- ("pink" %R% zero_or_more(WRD) %R% "red") # no doll contains a pink with a red doll anywhere within it

ind <- c()
for(i in 1:nrow(combs)){
    splitted <- stri_split_fixed(combs[i,], "_", simplify = T) # split the vectors into two
    
    ind[i] <- str_detect(paste(splitted[,1], collapse = ""), pattern_pink_red, 
               negate = T) # find patterns
    
}

combs_update <- combs[ind, ]
combs_update

```

Now, we move on to the second restriction. Unfortunately, we 2nd restriction is a quite vague, leading to different interpretations and different final solutions. Here are a few examples.

### 1st interpretation 
A way to interpret the restriction is to remove all solution where a pink dolls is inside a green which is *at the same time* inside a yellow one. This results in 9 solutions. 

```{r}
##### interpretation 1 
pattern_yellow_green_pink <- ("yellow" %R% zero_or_more(WRD) %R% "green" %R% zero_or_more(WRD) %R% "pink") # no yellow doll contains a green doll with a pink inside it. 


ind <- c()
for(i in 1:nrow(combs_update)){
    splitted <- stri_split_fixed(combs_update[i,], "_", simplify = T) # split the vectors into two
    
    ind[i] <- str_detect(paste(splitted[,1], collapse = ""), pattern_yellow_green_pink, 
                         negate = T) # find patterns
    
}

combs_update[ind, ]

```

### 2nd interpretation 

Another interpretation is to additionally remove solutions where pink is inside green, *independently* where yellow is. 

```{r}
# option 2 
pattern_green_pink <- ("green" %R% zero_or_more(WRD) %R% "pink") # no green doll with a pink doll anywhere within it
                              
ind <- c()
for(i in 1:nrow(combs_update)){
    splitted <- stri_split_fixed(combs_update[i,], "_", simplify = T) # split the vectors into two
    
    ind[i] <- str_detect(paste(splitted[,1], collapse = ""), or(pattern_yellow_green_pink, pattern_green_pink), 
                         negate = T) # find patterns
    
}

combs_update[ind, ]
```

### 3rd interpretation

```{r}
# option 3
pattern_yellow_green<- ("yellow" %R% zero_or_more(WRD) %R% "green")

ind <- c()
for(i in 1:nrow(combs_update)){
    splitted <- stri_split_fixed(combs_update[i,], "_", simplify = T) # split the vectors into two
    
    ind[i] <- str_detect(paste(splitted[,1], collapse = ""), or(pattern_yellow_green_pink, pattern_green_pink, pattern_yellow_green), 
                         negate = T) # find patterns
    
}

combs_update[ind, ]
```

This gives a unique solution `R1 P2 G3 Y4 B5` - which does not seem to violate any of the restrictions. Unfortuntately though it is different from the solution given by the New Scientist, which is `Y1 R2 P3 G4 B5`.
