# Biography

I'm a first year PhD student at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk/), supervised by [Paul Newcombe](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/n-to-s/paul-newcombe/) at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/). 
<br><br>
I'm interested in many areas across statistics, machine learning, and their interactions. My research focuses on tailored model development, that is targeted model building for a specific task of interest, mostly prediction. Under this scenario it is desired to use a metric which reflects the loss function to be used for the prediction problem thus "making" the model perform well for the particular task. Our approach is based on general Bayesian learning by incorporating loss functions into Bayesian inference. We will explore the use of such a framework for predictive and prognostic model building, whereby loss functions could be used to target metrics of real world clinical utility tailored to a particular setting. 
<br><br>
Before starting my PhD, I studied for a [MSc in Statistics](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/opleidingen/e/CQ_50550147.htm#activetab=diploma_omschrijving) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/). I focused on the Biometrics track and wrote my dissertation under the supervision of professor [Geert Verbeke](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00018341). I worked as Research Scientist at the MRC Biostatistics Unit during the 2016-2017 academic year supervised jointly by Paul Newcombe and [Chris Jackson](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/people/in-alphabetical-order/h-to-m/christopher-jackson/).

[comment]: <> (uncertainty quantification - model misspecification and loss function for bayesian (belief) updates. - For example, if different costs are associated with correct vs incorrect classifications, as is often the case when making decisions around treatments with known side effects, model estimation might benefit from directly targeting a utility function to reflect this information. On the other hand, if different biomarkers have different measurement costs, this could also be reflected using a utility function within a Bayesian variable selection framework to target a cost-effective final prognostic model. - http://mr504.user.srcf.net/)
