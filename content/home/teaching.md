- I have [supervised](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/undergrad/supervisions) 
[Statistics IB](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/study/IB/Statistics/), Lent 2019 (2nd year undergraduate course from the [Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/about/), University of Cambridge).

- This is the [handbook](/teaching/BrilliantClub_Handbook.pdf) for the course I teach as a Brilliant club tutor. [The Brilliant Club](https://thebrilliantclub.org/) is a charity aiming to increase the number of pupils from under-represented backgrounds progressing to highly selective universities. They do this by mobilising PhD researchers to share their academic expertise with state schools. 
   
   
   The material is designed for Key stage 4 pupils but can be easily adapted to Key stage 5. <br>

   About the course: 
   Virtually every decision is made in the face of uncertainty. In this course, I quantify uncertainty using probability theory. I then introduce the expected utility framework as a model of choice behaviour under uncertainty.
