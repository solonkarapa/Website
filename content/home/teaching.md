This is the [handbook](/teaching/BrilliantClub_Handbook.pdf) for the course I teach as a Brilliant club tutor. [The Brilliant Club](https://thebrilliantclub.org/) is a charity aiming to increase the number of pupils from under-represented backgrounds progressing to highly selective universities. They do this by mobilising PhD researchers to share their academic expertise with state schools. 

The material is designed for Key stage 4 pupils but can be easily adapted to Key stage 5. 

About the course: 
Virtually every decision is made in the face of uncertainty. In this course, I quantify uncertainty using probability theory. I then introduce the expected utility framework as a model of choice behaviour under uncertainty.
